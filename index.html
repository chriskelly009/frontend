    <p>Mental health matters. This is true today more than ever. In This
        fast-paced ever changing world, our mental health can be overlooked
        or ignored. This shouldn't happen. Through mental health awareness,
        you and I can bring light to this sometimes debilitating health 
        issue. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Some important areas of mental health awareness are
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reducing Stigma</li>
        <li>Improving Access to Mental Health Clinics</li>
        <li>Assistance with medication for those who can't afford it</li>
        <li>Early intervention</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
